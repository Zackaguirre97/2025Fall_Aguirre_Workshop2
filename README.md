# üìö Library Management System (Java)

A console-based library management application written in Java that allows users to view, check out, and return books.
Designed with modular classes to practice **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts such as **encapsulation, class interaction, and separation of concerns**.

## üöÄ Features

### Current Functionality

* **View All Books** ‚Äì Display every book in the library with full metadata (ID, ISBN, Title, Checkout Status).
* **View Available Books** ‚Äì Show only books currently available for checkout.
* **View Checked-Out Books** ‚Äì Show books currently checked out, along with the name of the person who borrowed them.
* **Check Out Books** ‚Äì Allows users to enter a valid Book ID and name to check out a book.
* **Check In Books** ‚Äì Allows users to return checked-out books by their Book ID.
* **Input Validation** ‚Äì Safely handles invalid or unexpected user input using `InputUtils.isInteger()` for numeric checks.

## üß© Class Overview

| Class            | Responsibility                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Book`**       | Represents a single book, storing its ID, ISBN, title, checkout status, and borrower. Includes methods for checking books in/out and displaying book data. |
| **`Library`**    | Manages a collection of `Book` objects. Handles displaying book lists, verifying IDs, and performing check-in/check-out logic.                             |
| **`Menu`**       | Provides a user interface via the console. Manages main menu navigation and user input flow for checking books in or out.                                  |
| **`InputUtils`** | Utility class with static helper methods for validating user input (currently only `isInteger()`).                                                         |
| **`Main`**       | Entry point for the application. Initializes the library with a predefined list of books and launches the main menu loop.                                  |

## üóÉÔ∏è Planned Additions

* **Persistent Data Storage** using *File I/O*

  * Save and load the library‚Äôs state (book list, checked-out books, and borrowers) between sessions.

* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

  * Add a JavaFX or Swing-based GUI for improved usability.
  * Replace text-based input with buttons, forms, and tables.

---

## üß† Design Principles

* **Encapsulation:** Each class handles its own data and logic.
* **Modularity:** The program separates concerns into distinct classes (`Book`, `Library`, `Menu`, etc.).
* **Scalability:** Designed to support future features (e.g., file persistence and GUIs) without major rewrites.
* **Error Handling:** Graceful input validation prevents crashes due to invalid user input.
